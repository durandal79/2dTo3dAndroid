notes about yaw, pitch and roll

yaw is a directional sensor that the top of the phone is pointing in - 0 North, 180 south
 
roll - in the horizontal degree of tilt towards the ground

pitch  - is the vertical degree of tilt towards the ground


==in horizontal position
roll = 90 then vertical
pitch = 0 then level

roll = 90 + pitch = 45 then the phone is vertical but rotated to the left

== can work out the angles between the two views pretty easily

== from those angles we can "correct" the images and triangulate to match up the images better

== from the corrected images we can detect features in one and identify in the other

==measure their shift

== and calculate what distance those features are from the viewer
